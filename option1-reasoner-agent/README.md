# Option 1: Reasoning Browsing Agent (AllHands.Dev)

## Overview

This implementation uses the **Reasoning Browsing Agent** developed by [Maitrix.org](https://github.com/maitrix-org/llm-reasoners/tree/main/examples/ReasonerAgent-Web).  
The ReasonerAgent is designed to autonomously interact with web applications using advanced reasoning capabilities powered by LLMs (Large Language Models). It simulates user behavior and performs complex browsing tasks through **multi-step reasoning**.

You can explore the live demo of the ReasonerAgent here:  
üëâ [https://easyweb.maitrix.org/](https://easyweb.maitrix.org/)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**  
This implementation is a practical adaptation of **one** of the many examples provided in the official `llm-reasoners` repository. For complete documentation, updates, and additional examples, refer to the official project:

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install `llm-reasoners`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maitrix-org/llm-reasoners.git
cd llm-reasoners
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Install Dependencies for ReasonerAgent

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Azure OpenAI Integration for ReasonerAgent-Web

This project modifies the official ReasonerAgent to utilize Azure OpenAI instead of the standard OpenAI API.

## Overview

By default, the ReasonerAgent from Maitrix.org uses the OpenAI API directly. This implementation adapts the code to work with Azure OpenAI, allowing users to leverage Azure's infrastructure and services.

## Modification Steps for `main.py`

1.  **Navigate to the Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /content/llm-reasoners/examples/ReasonerAgent-Web/
    ```

2.  **Edit `main.py`:**
    * Open `main.py` and locate the `model_info` dictionary.
    * Replace or add the `gpt-4o` configuration with the following:

    ```python
    'gpt-4o': (
        os.environ.get("AZURE_API_BASE", "[https://your-azure-openai-resource.openai.azure.com](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://your-azure-openai-resource.openai.azure.com)"),  # Replace with your Azure base URL
        'azure'
    )
    ```

3.  **Configure Azure Credentials:**
    * Ensure your Azure OpenAI credentials are correctly set in your environment variables.
    * See `credentials.txt` for a sample credentials file.

    üëâ [credentials.txt](credentials.txt)

## Quick Test Example

After configuring the settings, run a test query to verify the agent's functionality:

```bash
python main.py test_job --query "Who is the president of the USA?" --api_key "your-azure-api-key" --model "gpt-4o"
```

## Gradio Visualization Interface

To simplify the interaction with the ReasonerAgent and visualize its reasoning process, we have implemented two Gradio-based interfaces.

1.  **`Agent1.py`**
    * Displays the full execution log of the agent in real-time.

2.  **`Agent2.py`**
    * Displays the real-time execution log.
    * Once the process ends, the entire log is summarized using Azure OpenAI, providing a simplified final response.

### Run the Gradio Interfaces

```bash
python Agent1.py
```

or

```bash
python Agent2.py
```

## Notes

This implementation demonstrates the ReasonerAgent applied specifically to the WIPO Madrid Fee Calculator use case.
